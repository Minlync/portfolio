    (Class Assignment) </h1>
      <div class="p10 tc">
      <p>The 2020 was a tough year. The covid-19 pandemic was spreading on worldwide, some people lost loved friends and family members. People were forced to stay at home to avoid this fatal disease. However, brave essential workers and frontline workers still fight for our city. They kept our city would normally work.  Now, New York City is fully reopening! We have to salute these respectable people. So, the purpose of this poster was to gratitude these people, and thank them for their painstaking effort in our society.</p>
      <h2> Classic and Modern</h2>
      <p> New York City is a city combines classic and modern. Hundred years old landmark buildings can be seen everywhere, but they are cleverly integrated with new modern buildings to become the city’s landscape. This reminds me think of collage art in American graphic design in the early 50s and 60s. collage art is combining every different element but elaborate. It is similar with New York City’s character which is culture melting pot.
            Nowadays, most of concert or music festival posters will preferring use psychedelic style to grab audience attention. However, use vintage collage art style would let everyone know that this concert is not age-restricted and every New Yorker can participate in.</p>
